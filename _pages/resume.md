### Honors & Awards

* Consulting Excellence - Feburary 2018 - Teradata

* Distinguished Honors in Computer Science - April 2014 - Ursinus College
	* Thesis Abstract: A Connected Dominating Set (CDS) of the graph representing a Wireless Sensor Network can be used as a virtual backbone for routing through the network. Since the sensors of the network are constrained by limited battery life, we desire a small CDS for the network. However, the literature shows that constructing a minimum sized CDS for a large network takes too long for practical use. In this talk we present four algorithms for approximating a minimum CDS: a greedy, distributed algorithm and three variations of a randomized approach. We evaluate our algorithms using simulations and compare them to the two-hop K2 algorithm from the literature. Depending on the network topology, our greedy algorithm generally constructs a CDS that is 30% smaller in size than K2. After pruning, the randomized algorithms construct CDSs that are generally equivalent in size to K2 and which pass less messages and have a smaller time complexity.

* The Faculty Prize in Computer Science - April 2014 - Ursinus College
	* Established in 1989 by the faculty of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science and awarded to an outstanding computer science student.

* The MAA Prize for Service and Excellence in Mathematics - April 2014  - Ursinus College
	* Established in 2006 to recognize excellence in mathematics and service to the Student Chapter of the Mathematical Association of America or to the department.

* Phi Beta Kappa - March 2014 - Ursinus College
	* Phi Beta Kappa is a national academic honor society founded at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., on Dec. 5, 1776. The stated purpose of Phi Beta Kappa is to “recognize and encourage scholarship, friendship, and cultural interests.” The Ursinus College chapter, Tau of Pennsylvania, was approved on October 19, 1991. Composed of faculty members holding Phi Beta Kappa keys, the chapter confers membership on the basis of “high scholarship, liberal culture, and good character.” Election to Phi Beta Kappa is considered the highest academic honor for undergraduate students.

* Upsilon Pi Epsilon - May 2013 - Ursinus College
	* Upsilon Pi Epsilon is an honorary society whose membership consists of outstanding undergraduate and graduate students in Computing and Information Disciplines. Only schools that offer a degree in a computing science-related discipline may be chartered. Likewise, prospective student members must be working toward a degree in Computing and Information Disciplines at the time they are considered for membership. Yet members are chosen not only for their scholastic achievement in a computing science program, but also for distinguishing themselves as true professionals by meeting the standards of the society. Membership is limited to those who can effectively achieve the original goals of the society. These goals include: The recognition of outstanding talent in the field of computing science, The promotion of high scholarship in computing science, The establishment and maintenance of high standards in computing science, The representation of computing science in interdisciplinary communications, and The encouragement of individual contributions to society through computing science.

* The Miriam and Irving N Rosenthal Memorial Award - April 2013 Ursinus College
	* Established in 1989 by the gift of Professor William E. Rosenthal to commemorate in perpetuity his beloved parents, who instilled in him a sense of the intrinsic value of lifelong learning. To be awarded to a female rising senior who has clearly demonstrated an interest in pursuing graduate study in the mathematical sciences.

* Kappa Mu Epsilon  - May 2012 - Ursinus College
	* Kappa Mu Epsilon is a specialized honor society in Mathematics. KME was founded in 1931 to promote the interest of mathematics among undergraduate students. Its chapters are located in colleges and universities of recognized standing which offer a strong mathematics major. The chapters' members are selected from students of mathematics and other closely related fields who have maintained standards of scholarship, have professional merit, and have attained academic distinction. Both men and women are eligible for membership.
