Here's what I've been up to in Spring of 2020 

## Books

* [A Beginners Guide to Python 3 Programming](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-030-20290-3)
    * Was available free on Springer for a while - a nice refresher on how the language works which I'm enjoying as someone that never formally learned the lanuage from anywhere other than StackOverflow

## Movies
 * [Clue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clue_(film))
    * Tim Curry is an absolute treasure and also Miss Scarlet is GOALS
 * [Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker)
    * Stay-at-home date night :) 

## Music
* 00s Pop Punk Stables
    * [Brand New: Deja Entendu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deja_Entendu)
    * [Brand New: Your Favorite Weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Favorite_Weapon)
    * [Jack's Mannequin: Everything in Transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_in_Transit)

## Podcasts
* [The Dream](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/stitcher/the-dream)
    * Season one on MLMs was BONKERS and I highly recommend to anyone and everyone
    * Season two on wellness was fine - a nice personal story still with good journalism but less cohesive

## TV Shows

* [Dracula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula_(2020_TV_series))
    * I am not typically a horror fan, I did a lot of looking away from the screen, but I also watched all 3 1.5 hour episodes in one sitting and was absolutely entranced
* [Quantico Season 1 & 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantico_(TV_series))
    * Good trash save-the-world/fbi show
