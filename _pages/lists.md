Here's what I've been up to in Spring of 2020 

## Books

### Currently Reading

* [A Beginners Guide to Python 3 Programming](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-030-20290-3)
    * Was available free on Springer for a while - a nice refresher on how the language works which I'm enjoying as someone that never formally learned the lanuage from anywhere other than StackOverflow


### Finished
* [Just Kids by Patti Smith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341879.Just_Kids)
    * In 2011, Patti Smith came to Ursinus College to give a talk - I went because of a boy, of course - and was absolutely transformed. My love of Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, the 70s come from this day. I read this book at the end of every year of college but haven't come back to it for a few years. Seems appropriate to revisit in this new time of transition as I take "summer break" from my tech  job to focus on the baby.
* [Yes, Please by Amy Poehler](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20910157-yes-please)
    * This was fun
    
### Abandoned 

## Movies

* [Fire Bringer](https://www.teamstarkid.com/firebringer)
    * I don't really want to do the work today 
* [Clue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clue_(film))
    * Tim Curry is an absolute treasure and also Miss Scarlet is GOALS
* [Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker)
    * Stay-at-home date night :)

## Podcasts

* [S-Town](https://stownpodcast.org)
    * I finished this is a day - it was amazing and heartbreaking
* [The Dream](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/stitcher/the-dream)
    * Season one on MLMs was BONKERS and I highly recommend to anyone and everyone
    * Season two on wellness was fine - a nice personal story still with good journalism but less cohesive

## TV Shows

* [Dracula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula_(2020_TV_series))
    * I am not typically a horror fan, I did a lot of looking away from the screen, but I also watched all 3 1.5 hour episodes in one sitting and was absolutely entranced
* [Quantico Season 1 & 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantico_(TV_series))
    * Good trash save-the-world/fbi show
