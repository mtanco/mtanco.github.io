Here's what I've been up to in 2020 

## Books

### Currently Reading
* Blue Adept by Piers Anthony


### Finished
* Split Infinity by Piers Anthony
* [There's No Such Thing as Bad Weather by  Linda Ã…keson McGurk](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34466962-there-s-no-such-thing-as-bad-weather)
* [On Becoming Babywise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Becoming_Baby_Wise)
    * This was a gift from a coworker, some of the implications are dated (happy babies are raised by a married man and woman :/// ) but many of the topics on schedules and sleep have been very helpful 
* [Dealing with Dragons by Patricia C. Wrede](https://www.amazon.com/Dealing-Dragons-Enchanted-Forest-Chronicles/dp/0590457225)
    * Book one of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles - favorites from my childhood
* [The Brain Fog Fix by Dr. Mike Dow](https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Fog-Fix-Reclaim-Memory/dp/1401946488)
    * This was an interesting read and I learned a lot, def not implementing the 3 week plan, although I have incorporated some of his suggestions into my daily life
* [Just Kids by Patti Smith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341879.Just_Kids)
    * In 2011, Patti Smith came to Ursinus College to give a talk - I went because of a boy, of course - and was absolutely transformed. My love of Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, the 70s come from this day. I read this book at the end of every year of college but haven't come back to it for a few years. Seems appropriate to revisit in this new time of transition as I take "summer break" from my tech  job to focus on the baby.
* [Yes, Please by Amy Poehler](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20910157-yes-please)
    * This was fun
