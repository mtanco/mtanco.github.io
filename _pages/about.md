Hi! I'm Michelle and I like to solve problems. 

I **work** as Customer Solution Engineer and Data Scientist at [H2O.ai](http://h2o.ai). 

Previously, I was a Senior Consultant for [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com/) in the Data Science Deliveries team. 


I tend to **play** by coding and tinkering. The main point of this site to host the output of my learning and personal projects. 

Outside of the computer, my main hobbies are spending time with my **dog & husband**, playing **ukulele**, and flipping around at my adult **gymnastics** class.
