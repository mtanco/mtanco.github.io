Hi! I'm Michelle and I like to solve problems. 

I **work** as a Senior Consultant for [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com/) in our Data Science Deliveries team. This often means I'm either galavanting accross the US or holed up in my home office, working with our customers to derive business value out of their data. The sorts of projects I've been focused on recently are:

* Network optimization
* Predictive asset maintenance 
* Event prediction in time series data
* Cross channel customer engagement 

I tend to **play** by coding and tinkering. The main point of this site to host the output of these fun, personal projects. 

Outside of the computer, my main hobbies are spending time with my **dog & husband**, playing **ukulele**, and flipping around at my adult **gymnastics** class.
